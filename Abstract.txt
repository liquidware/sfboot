The Blinky project is a simple program for the LPC2138
using Keil MCB2130 Microcontroller Board.

It blinks the LEDs at speed according to the Potentiometer 
setting and prints the current seting to the Serial Port 1.
In addition it generates a sine wave with an adjustable 
frequency on the speaker of the board.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in µVision Simulator
  MCB2100 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for target debugging or free run)
